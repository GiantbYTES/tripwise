# How to Use the Gemini API

This guide explains how to set up and use the Gemini API for other developers on the team.

## Setup Instructions

To use the Gemini API, you will need to have your own API key from Google.

### 1. Obtain a Gemini API Key

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Create a new API key.

### 2. Create a `.env` File

1.  In the `BackEnd` folder of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you obtained from Google AI Studio:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

### 3. Start the Server

Once your `.env` file is in place, you can start the server by running the following command from the root of the `tripwise` project:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Using the API

You can now send `POST` requests to the `/api/gemini/generate` endpoint.

### Example using Postman:

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/gemini/generate`
*   **Body:**
    *   Select `raw` and `JSON`.
    *   Enter the following in the text area:
        ```json
        {
            "prompt": "Your text prompt here"
        }
        ```
*   **Headers:**
    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`

The API will return a text response generated by the Gemini model.

# Tripwise Gemini API Integration

This document summarizes the steps taken to integrate the Google Gemini API into the Tripwise backend.

## Summary of Work

1.  **API Endpoint Creation**: A new API endpoint was established at `/api/gemini/generate` to handle requests to the Gemini service.

2.  **Environment Variable Management**: The `dotenv` package was utilized to manage the Gemini API key securely. A `.env` file is used to store the key, which is loaded at runtime.

3.  **Security**: A `.gitignore` file was created to prevent the `.env` file (containing the API key) from being committed to the version control system.

4.  **Dependency Installation**: The `@google/generative-ai` npm package was installed to facilitate communication with the Gemini API.

5.  **API Routing and Control**:
    *   `routes/geminiRouter.js`: This file defines the route for the API.
    *   `controllers/geminiController.js`: This file contains the core logic for interacting with the Gemini API, including handling requests and responses.

6.  **Server Integration**: The main server file, `index.js`, was updated to incorporate the `geminiRouter`.

7.  **Debugging and Refinement**: The integration process involved debugging several issues, including:
    *   Correctly loading the API key from the `.env` file by specifying the correct path.
    *   Updating the Gemini model name to a valid and available version (`gemini-1.5-flash`).
